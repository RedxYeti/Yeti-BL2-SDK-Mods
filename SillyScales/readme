If you're playing single player I highly recommend using the Alternate player scale.

Wacky NPC Scale is only for fun. The only way to damage them is explosions or melee with that option on.

This mod does work co op with a few issues:
Cars only get rescaled for hosts
Alternate player scale will not work correctly
