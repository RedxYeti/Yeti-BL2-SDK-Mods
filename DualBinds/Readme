Dual Binds will accept any key input and run any command after it.
For example, if you want your mousewheel scroll to also be use and pick up items it would look like this:

MouseScrollUp, Use, PickupSomething 0
MouseScrollDown, Use, PickupSomething 0

There's no limit to how many commands you put as long as each is separated by a comma. If you want a key to do 10 things, that will work.

You can also use Shift, Control or Alt before commands. You can also leave comments for binds using # at the front of the line.

#Drop Reload Example
Shift + Seven, ThrowWeapon, PickupSomething 1
