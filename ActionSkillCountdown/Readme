After install, go ingame and use your action skill and wait for the cooldown.

Once the cooldown ends, you'll see the timer in the top left.

Pause the game and set the colors you'd like and move it using the sliders to where you want in the mod settings.

Optionally, turn on movement keys

Close the pause menu and see if its where you want it.

If its not, if you turned on the movement keys you can use the arrowkeys to fine adjust the position and scroll wheel to change the size.

Once you have it where you want, I suggest turning off show in menu and movement keys.
