This mod will randomize projectiles all over your game. There's 2 types of things it randomizes. One is called "Firing Mode" and the other is called "Projectile".

Firing modes are mostly used on weapons. Guns and vehicles use them.

Projectiles are mostly used on grenades, however firing modes can have projectiles tied to them.
