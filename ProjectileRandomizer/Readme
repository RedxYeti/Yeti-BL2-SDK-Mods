This mod will randomize projectiles all over your game. There's 2 types of things it randomizes. One is Firing Modes and the other is Projectiles.

Firing modes are mostly used on weapons. Guns and vehicles use them.

Projectiles are mostly used on grenades, however firing modes can have projectiles tied to them. Weapons also have a 50/50 chance of projectiles being changed or even added to their firing mode.

You'll see on the item card what each has been randomized to. 


Prepping randomizer:
I HIGHLY recommend you use the prep randomizer option in the settings. It will load multiple levels until it's found the set amount of firing modes and projectiles.

The easiest way to prep the randomizer is to start a new boosted character, let it finish loading the maps, and then just delete that new boosted character.

It only takes 2-3 minutes and you'll be set for your entire session.

If you find your game crashing while trying to use the randomizer prep, id recommend lowering projectiles first, then firing modes.

You can also use the 4gb patch on the exe, which may help a bit. https://ntcore.com/4gb-patch/


Saving Items:
Items will get saved to a text file in "saves" in the projectile randomizer. The save number will be the same as your character save number.

Items only save when you save and quit to the main menu. 

You can edit these saves by replacing the parts that you want. Youll just have to find the barrel, Firing mode, and/or projectile you want to replace in the text file.

The mod also keeps track of every loaded firing mode and projectile in the saves folder in text files with their respective names.
