Update1.2: (i forgot to change it in game)
Fixed some NPC's not randomizing
Hopefully fixed the save/load system

If you find you're still having issues with save/load system, after closing the game set your save json to read only.
Then after you've finished prepping the randomizer, load in game, then remove the read only. You can leave it off read only until next game launch.
