Version 1.1b:
I re-enabled auto swap to weapons when you dont have one in your hands because krieg was having issues.
Auto swap was disabled because when removing equipped weapons, it could be confusing which slot you were on if the game swapped it for you.

Issues:
Four slot Gunzerker while gunzerkering is jank. The script will attempt to skip over your left hand weapon while gunzerking.
If you dont have gun during action skill, you just have to press the quick slot key to get it back (1-4 or dpad).

One slot gunzerker works fine.

Mission weapons do not auto equip.
